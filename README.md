**5G3E (5G End-to-End Emulation) dataset**

The 5G3E (5G End-to-End Emulation) dataset contains monitoring metrics of a virtualized 5G infrastructure.

The dataset is created using real commercial cellular network traffic anonymized traces over a period of 14 days, injected over an emulated 5G platform including emulated radio access and 5G core network. 

The possible usages of the dataset include, but are not limited to, learning and data analysis in relation to novel network automation architectures, protocols and algorithms.

**DATASET DESCRIPTION**

The dataset contains time-series system metrics, built at different sampling rates, related to the observation of multiple resources involved in 5G network operation: radio, computing and network resources. The variety of collected features  ranges  from  radio  front-end  metrics  to  physical  server, from operating system to network function metrics. Few thousands of such features are collected, grouped by resource type and/or node type.

A detailed description of the employed 5G testbed at Cnam is given and of the v1 of the dataset are given in the paper above.

Additional versions with additional features (protocols, network functions, with edge computing elements, channel propagation models and events, etc) and setting (multipath transport, usage of WiFi, LiFi, Ethernet interfaces at the UE, etc) will be published further on.
